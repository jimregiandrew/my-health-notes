I have an idea. I have Long Covid, although I am much improved. I have started keeping an electronic diary of my health and some general activities (e.g.  a rough summary of what I did and when each day). I log things such as the food I eat and when, fatigue (the Long Covid / CFS type fatigue), bowel movements, heart rate, mood, anxiety and sleep. I use subjective rating scales, that I define, for things like mood, anxiety and and fatigue. Usually a numeric scale from 0-10. I have kept a fairly comprehensive diary since the start of December 2025. And I have kept a simple fatigue scale for much of the last 2 years. I found the latter particularly useful to determine when major PEM events clearly happened, and what was the likely trigger (when I regressed significantly I kept a note of what I did on the day before etc.) I suspect that by keeping a diary that further insights can be gained. Since AI works well with free form data it is a tool that could be given this information to gain further insights. If many people record their personal health notes / diary for themselves (or e.g. for their children) then AI could gain potentially great insights. To the extent that it could help focus research onto better understanding the disease and potential cures. This seems to me to apply to many diseases where the etiology is not well understood or "invisible illnesses" - diseases where medcine and science have potentially a lot to learn.
