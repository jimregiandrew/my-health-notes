I have an idea. I have Long Covid, although I am much improved. I have started keeping an electronic diary of my health and some general activities (e.g.  a rough summary of what I did and when each day). I log things such as the food I eat and when, fatigue (the Long Covid / CFS type fatigue), bowel movements, heart rate, mood, anxiety and sleep. I use subjective rating scales, that I define, for things like mood, anxiety and and fatigue. Usually a numeric scale from 0-10. I have kept a fairly comprehensive diary since the start of December 2025. And I have kept a simple fatigue scale for much of the last 2 years. I found recording my fatigue particularly useful to determine when major PEM events clearly happened, and what was the likely trigger (when I regressed significantly I kept a note of what I did on the day before etc.) E.g. after 2 months I had nagging suspicion that PEM events were occuring, but at that stage I didn't know about PEM. When I found out about it later a light went off in my head, and I could clearly identify the PEM events. I would have been better off if I had had this knowledge earlier. 

I suspect that keeping a more comprehensive diary could offer further insights. Particular if multiple peopke keep diaries. If many people record their personal health notes / diary for themselves (or e.g. for their children) then we could gain potentially great insights. To the extent that it could help focus research onto better understanding the disease and potential cures. This seems to me to apply particularly to many diseases where the etiology is not well understood or "invisible illnesses" - diseases where medicine and science have potentially a lot to learn.

Further for various reasons I think AI could accelerate our understanding (insights):

1. AI works well with free form data
2. It can analyse massive data sets and find hidden relationships
3. It is a great exploratory tool
4. AI is seeing rapid advances
